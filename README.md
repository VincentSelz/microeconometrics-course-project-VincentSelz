In the notebook [Project-VincentSelz.ipynb](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/microeconometrics-course-project-VincentSelz/blob/master/Project-VincentSelz.ipynb), I replicate the core findings of the following paper:


* Gill, David, and Victoria Prowse. 2012. [A Structural Analysis of Disappointment Aversion in a Real Effort Competition.](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.102.1.469) *American Economic Review*, 102 (1): 469-503.


## Project overview

### Paper

Gill and Prowse (2012) use a sequential real effort tournament to test experimentally whether agents exhibit disappointment aversion. They find significant evidence for an discouragement effect and use the Method of Simulated Moments to estimate the strength of disappointment aversion on average and investigate heterogeneity.

### Contribution

My contribution is by replicating the reduced form analysis of the paper and to add data visualisations. I also attempt to replicate their core result - the structural estimation - however, I was not able to get the criterion function up and running. I am following the [respy](https://respy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) outline and document the steps I have taken to replicate the MSM.
